# Aloha Clothing - Project 1

## Summary
This mock clothing store was developed to introduce us to HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Flexbox. This responsive site uses a bxslider
function, smooth scrolling, and a fixed header.

## How I Built This Site:
* HTML/CSS
* jQuery
* Flexbox
* Git
* Mobile first/resposinve approach

## Summary

This project was a great way to review HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It was also great to learn flexbox, not having to use floats
is a great relief! It was also a great learning experience to develop sites using design comps, and having to construct 
the site as close to those comps as possible.
